If you downloaded the complete system, you just need to 
set the shell variable MPTPDIR to the base MPTP directory -
e.g. "export MPTPDIR=/home/urban/MPTP".

After that you can try the mkproblem.pl script in
MPTPDIR/SCRIPTS, e.g. "./mkproblem.pl -tcard_1 -trolle -crolle".
If it does not work, you probably need to install the 
DB_File perl module. In most distributions it is either 
part of the perl rpm, or (e.g. in redhat8.0) something 
like "perl-DB_File". Last resort is to get it from CPAN.

For reproving, you need the SPASS prover 
(http://spass.mpi-sb.mpg.de). Look at the FAQ here for 
more info.


If you want to generate the DB from your Mizar distro,
you additionally need:
- Mizar version 6.3 (tested with 6.3.02)
- to set the top variables in Makefile.vars
- about 600M additional space for tmp Mizar files
- about 1 hour on P4 to generate the DB

The installation is done by running "make cleaninstall"
in MPTPDIR.
